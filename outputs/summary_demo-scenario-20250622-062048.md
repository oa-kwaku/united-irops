of Operational Activity

## Major Actions Taken
- Dispatch Operations identified exceptions with Thunderstorm (TS) and Fog (FG) violations
- Crew Operations completed analysis and identified need for 2 crew substitutions

## Crew Substitutions Made
- Flight UA102: UA003
- Flight UA101: UA010, UA000

## Delay Advisories Published
- No delay advisories were published during this period

Remaining Issues/Risks:
- Ongoing weather-related dispatch exceptions (Thunderstorm and Fog conditions)
- These weather violations remain unresolved based on the last status update

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Monitor weather conditions and reassess dispatch status once TS/FG conditions improve
2. Verify crew substitutions have been properly implemented
3. Consider if delay advisories may be needed if weather conditions persist
4. Continue monitoring dispatch status for resolution of weather-related violations

The situation shows active weather-related challenges being managed with crew adjustments made, though weather violations remain active. Close monitoring of conditions and potential impact on operations should continue.
