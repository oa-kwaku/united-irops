Remaining Issues/Risks:
1. Weather-related violations (Thunderstorm and Fog) remain unresolved
2. Multiple flights affected by weather delays at ORD

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Continue monitoring weather conditions affecting operations
2. Verify effectiveness of crew substitutions
3. Assess potential downstream impacts of ORD delays
4. Consider proactive passenger notifications for affected flights
5. Maintain heightened situational awareness due to weather conditions

The situation requires continued monitoring, particularly of weather conditions at ORD. While crew substitutions have been implemented and delay advisories published, the persistent weather violations suggest potential for additional operational impacts.
